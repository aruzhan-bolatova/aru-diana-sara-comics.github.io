# "Chorus of Change" Comics Website

Welcome to a creative fusion of comics, audio, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that weaves the compelling tale of a singer's journey through the challenges and triumphs that remained hidden behind the curtain.

**Objective**

In this project, our objective was to provide a unique storytelling experience that delves into the life of a singer, spotlighting the struggles that often go unnoticed in her pursuit of a dream.

**Storytelling Experience**

As you navigate through our digital creation, you'll be met with a seamless interface that beautifully weaves the story. The transitions between comic boxes are smooth, creating a cinematic effect, allowing the story to unfold organically. To enrich the storytelling experience, we've incorporated audio elements that resonate with the narrative. The use of background music adds depth and dimension to the story, immersing the audience further into the singer's world.


**Process & Behind the Scenes**

Meticulously hand-drawn comics, reflecting hours of dedicated sketching and drawing using Adobe Illustrator, became the core of our storytelling. The technical intricacies of countless lines of code posed their own set of challenges. Late nights were spent perfecting the website's seamless user interface. However, every hurdle was met with determination, leading to the creation of “Chorus of Change.”

**"Everyone Has Their Backstage"**

We believe that "Everyone Has Their Backstage." It's a reminder that beyond the spotlight and the applause, there's a personal journey filled with challenges, determination, and dreams.

Thank you.
